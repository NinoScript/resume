        I’ve been a self-taught programmer and
        robotic hobbyist since I was 12 years old
        
        I’m a bit competitive, that’s why I love
        being surrounded by smart people.
    about me: >
        I love both loose leaf tea and fresh ground coffee.
        
        I like to chat, watch movies and explore
        new places while riding my bike.
